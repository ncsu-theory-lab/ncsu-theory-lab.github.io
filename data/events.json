    "abstract": "In this talk, I shall state the 'Bar fight prevention' problem, which is nothing but the classical vertex cover problem in graph theory. We start from a naive approach, and progressively develop algorithms through 8 stages of refinement. Also, we explore 2 counterproductive ways, illustrating potential pitfalls to avoid in certain variations of the Bar fight prevention problem. This journey leads us to the realm of Parameterized algorithms, highlighting their significance in tackling practical optimization problems. The talk is self-contained."
